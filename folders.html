                            <p class="paragraph paragraph--white">Folders make payments much easier! They allow you to store banking details that share a common category for easy recognition. For example, you could create a folder called "Salaries" and save the banking details of all employees you pay salaries to. Another folder could be called "Creditors", storing all the banking details of suppliers or outsourced labour you pay for.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph paragraph--white">We also recommend that you verify the banking details first via Business Solutions → Verify Account Owner → Verify, and then select to store them in folders by clicking on the 'Save as Recipient' button made available on the Verify Account Owner Results screen.</p>

                            <p class="paragraph paragraph--white">This ensures that the person you are paying owns the account you are paying into. It'll save time for people capturing your payments, because everything is stored in logical groups and easy to find. This will also speed up the entire authorise process for the Authorisers, as they won't need to recheck these details again.</p>
